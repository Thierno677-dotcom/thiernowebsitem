<h1>Homework 2: Cropping and Resizing</h1>

<p>To me   in my opinion   photography is more like capturing and keeping memories   and with photography   it's almost like storytelling because with a photo   you can tell so many things. Taking a picture isn't about taking the picture,   it's about keeping the memories. A picture has the capability of capturing a moment of   time, which could've   been a memory soon to be forgotten. In Plato   cave, Susan Sontag talks about the fact that photos do not passively describe what is present in the world, but instead they determine what we see and how we see it. This makes sense to me   since I don't always take photos by reflex   when I look back at them   I not only remember the moment and context of the picture, I also remember the feeling or the reason why I took the picture in the first place.

I don't believe that photography is all about putting together pictures. But it's more like telling a story. For example   if I took a picture of people walking in the rain i'm   not just simplying   taking a picture of people walking in the rain, im   capturing the mood, environment, and astheic   that the picture gives. Even when it seems so simple   there is something about the picture you can notice. We live in a world full of pictures that capture the moment. People take pictures almost everyday.   The context of a picture can be changed by adding words to see how we view it. A picture may be funny, sad   or political with the help of a caption. If you just add a caption to a photo, it is made out to look like a dream or display a number of emotions that a television or film camera will never capture.

A thought of the world today would have me wishing to demonstrate how people really feel. I would attempt to preserve the anguish, the hopelessness, yet the hope. Anything, just to take sitting on the subway as an example, too many people are sitting next to each other and at the same time too much apart because they are all compelled to look into their phones. Even something like a photo of a person eating takeout after a busy working day or kids playing in the park tell a lot about the way people live. I believe that integrating such images with words or even drawings may contribute to the development of the complete picture of what the life is like nowadays.

 The art of photography to me is a mixture of a message and a memory. I would use it to remind me of things I would've   forgotten, though I also use it to show what I believe is important. I believe that adding text or other pictures to the pictures also allow   me to capture what the world is like, but also what it actually feels like at this time. And that's what makes image making exciting, that   it is not just simply about the picture, it is also about the narration you use the picture to tell. It's about how you can always go and look back and remincise   about the picture and the moment of the picture.</p>
